# Big Money Slot Machine 
- This game is a digital version of the normal slot machine found in all casinos. It has a spin button which gives a player 3 random images. If all three images match then a player gets a win message. If the images do not match then the player gets a message stating they have lost. The score is recorded at the bottom of the page.

# Future Plans
- In the future I am planning on adding new codes that will make the game more user friendly. I also want to add some codes that will give the player a option to bet some money and have a spinning image animation.
