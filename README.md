# Big Money Slot Machine 
This game is a digital version of the normal slot machine found in all casinos. It has a spin button which gives a player 3 random images. If all three images match then a player gets a win message. If the images do not match then the player gets a message stating they have lost. The score is recorded at the bottom of the page.

# Future plans
In the future I am hoping to add new codes into the program in order to get the game running more user friendly. I am also hoping to learn new codes that can add features like betting money and animations.
